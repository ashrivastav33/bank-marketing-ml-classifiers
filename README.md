# Bank Marketing ML — Term Deposit Prediction
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, financial, and campaign-related features. The goal is to evaluate and compare multiple classification models and use data visualization to support model interpretation and performance analysis.

## How to get started
In order to get this project running please download the code using the git clone command

  - 'git clone git@github.com:ashrivastav33/bank-marketing-ml-classifiers.git'

## Note
- We are making an assumption you already are familiar with using Jupyter Notebook using tools like Google Colab or Jupyter etc.
- You will need an internet connection to download/read the dataset or csv file

## Project Structure

### - /data/bank-additional-full.csv    ---> Stores the dataset used for this project
### - /code/bank-marketing-ml_ashri33.ipynb            ---> Stores the code/jupyter notebook used for this project

# Dataset

## Results


- Key Insights:


## Conclusion

### Learning

- It was fun to work on this assignment, I did learn that building and comparing different machine learning models requires understanding the dataset, applying the concepts which can take time and practice
- Machine Learning model can initially take time to run if the dataset it huge and we can easily overfit or underfit the model
- Its easy to get lost and keep track of your machine learning model flow, hence keep track of what you are doing either in a notepad or roughbook

## Next Steps and Recommendations

 - We can explore more scenarios to learn meaningful insights from the data
